This repository contains course materials for my TA section (504) for POLS 309. 
In this class, we learn how the basics of data science in Political Science. 
In the lab sections I host on Mondays, we will use R and RStudio to work with data. 
Each week we will have an in-class activity we do for lab where I walk you through R code to teach you how to do your lab reports. 
Once we are done with class, I will post an answer key for each in-class activity. 
This code will remain here for you all to access throughout the semester and once our time in class is over.
