## POLS 309: Politmetrics

[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)](https://xkcd.com/552/)


This repository contains course materials for my TA sections (902 & 907) for POLS 209. 
In this class, we learn how the basics of research design and methods in Political Science. 
In the lab sections I host on Fridays, we will use R and RStudio to work with data. 
Each week we will have an in-class activity we do for lab where I walk you through R code to teach you how to do your lab reports. 
Once we are done with class, I will post an answer key for each in-class activity. 
This code will remain here for you all to access throughout the semester and once our time in class is over.
